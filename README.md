# logit-models
Logistic regression ML models. including Kaggle Titanic survivor prediction

### Project Overview
#### Titanic survivor prediction model:
decision functions predict survival outcomes from the Titanic based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. 
It starts with a simple algorithm and increases in complexity.
Objective: to reach an outcomes prediction accuracy rate of 80% of the passengers
Project is part of intro to machine learning Nanodegree program with Udacity.
